# STORY-025: Add tests for fetch_data_from_riksbank function

## Description
As a developer, I need comprehensive tests for the `fetch_data_from_riksbank` function to ensure it correctly interacts with Riksbanken APIs, handles errors properly, and correctly processes paginated data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create unit tests for `fetch_data_from_riksbank` that test:
  - Successful GET requests
  - Successful POST requests
  - Error handling for HTTP errors
  - Error handling for network errors
  - Handling of paginated responses
  - Parameter passing to the underlying API client
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for all code paths in the function
- [ ] Use proper mocking to avoid actual API calls during tests
- [ ] Verify the function correctly handles both SWEA and TORA API types
- [ ] Verify the function correctly processes and combines paginated data

## Implementation Notes
- The `fetch_data_from_riksbank` function was implemented as part of STORY-003
- The function is located in `src/services/api.py` 
- Similar tests exist for the underlying `RiksbankApiClient` in `tests/test_riksbank_api.py`
- Tests should verify that pagination handling works correctly
- Consider testing edge cases like empty responses or malformed data

## Dependencies
