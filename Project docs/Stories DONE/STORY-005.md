# STORY-005: Implement TORA API integration

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement specific service functions to interact with Riksbanken's TORA API, so that the MCP server can access interest rate data and financial market information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create TORA API specific service module
- [x] Implement function to fetch interest rate data from TORA API
- [x] Handle TORA-specific data formats and responses
- [x] Properly parse and transform TORA API responses into usable data structures
- [x] Add detailed error handling for TORA-specific error conditions
- [x] Implement caching for TORA API responses where appropriate
- [x] Create unit tests for TORA API integration
- [x] Document all implemented TORA API endpoints

## Implementation Notes
- Base URL for TORA API: https://api.riksbank.se/tora/v1
- Key endpoint: /interestrate
- Review the TORA API documentation for parameter requirements
- Consider implementing pagination handling for large result sets
- Map TORA API responses to application data models
- Interest rates may include different rate types that need to be categorized

## Implementation Progress
- Created `src/services/tora_api.py` with `ToraApiService` class
- Implemented `get_interest_rates` method with support for:
  - Date range filtering
  - Interest rate ID filtering
  - Pagination via limit parameter
  - Caching support
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Created unit tests in `tests/test_tora_api.py`
- Integrated with existing base API service from STORY-003
- Added response transformation to match application data models

## Dependencies
- STORY-003: Create base API service for Riksbanken (âœ… Completed)

## Estimated Effort
Medium: 2-3 days

## Status
Completed

## Test Scenarios
1. Test fetching interest rate data for specific dates
2. Test fetching specific interest rate types
3. Test error handling for invalid parameters
4. Test pagination handling for large result sets
5. Test response parsing and transformation
