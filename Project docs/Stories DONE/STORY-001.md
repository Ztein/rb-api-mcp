# STORY-001: Implement OAuth2 client credentials authentication

## Description
As a developer, I need to implement OAuth2 client credentials flow authentication to connect with Riksbanken's APIs so that the MCP server can securely access financial data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create a configuration mechanism for storing Riksbanken API credentials
- [x] Implement OAuth2 client credentials flow to obtain access tokens
- [x] Handle HTTP errors and authentication failures gracefully
- [x] Add proper logging for authentication events
- [x] Implement secure handling of credentials (environment variables or secure vault)
- [x] Create unit tests for authentication flow

## Implementation Notes
- Riksbanken uses OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow
- Token endpoint: https://api.riksbank.se/oauth2/token
- Authentication requires POST request with client_id and client_secret
- Access tokens expire, so we'll need to track expiry and refresh when needed

## Implementation Approach
- Created a `.env.example` file to document required environment variables
- Implemented `RiksbankAuth` class in `src/services/auth.py` that:
  - Handles token acquisition and refresh
  - Includes proper error handling
  - Implements token caching with expiration
  - Logs authentication events
- Created `RiksbankApiClient` in `src/services/riksbank_api.py` that:
  - Wraps the authentication logic
  - Provides helper methods for API requests
  - Includes comprehensive error handling
- Added unit tests with nearly 100% coverage
- Used environment variables for secure credential storage

## Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational story)

## Estimated Effort
Medium: 2-3 days

## Status
Complete

## Test Scenarios
1. Test successful authentication with valid credentials
2. Test failed authentication with invalid credentials
3. Test token expiry and refresh mechanism
4. Test proper handling of network errors 

## Result
Successfully implemented OAuth2 client credentials authentication for Riksbanken APIs with good test coverage and error handling. The solution automatically manages token lifecycle and provides a clean interface for making authenticated API requests.
